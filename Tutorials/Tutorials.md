# Machine Learning Pipeline for PDAC Biomarker Discovery

Welcome to the tutorial for the machine learning pipeline used for PDAC biomarker discovery. This guide is divided into several sections to help you navigate through the different steps of the process.

## Sections:

1. [TMM_norm](#tmm_norm): Data cleaning and TMM normalisation
2. [Gene_filter](#gene_filter): Gene filtering by a criteria
3. [Data_integration](#data_integration): Data integration and batch effect correction
4. [Variable_selection](#variable_selection): A combination of variable selection methods
5. [Model](#model): Random Forest model (RF) in training and validation
