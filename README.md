# ML_PDACBiomarker

## Project Title : 
Robust and Consistent Biomarker Identification of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Metastasis by Machine Learning Approach

## Description
We provided the full R codes and data for biomarker discovery using RNA seq data from cancer patients, including R code, Rmarkdown codes, and Tutorials (HTML) in 5 sections. This is a part of our publication titled “Robust and Consistent Biomarker Identification of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Metastasis by Machine Learning Approach” in BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making Journal. 

## Installation
Please follow the tutorials and R codes; we have a custom function that includes many R packages that need to be installed and packages in each section. 

## Usage
You should follow the R codes by following the sections,
1.TMM_norm : Data cleaning and TMM normalisation
2.Gene_filter : Gene filtering by a criteria
3.Data_integration : Data integration and batch effect correction
4.Variable selection : A combination of variable selection methods
5.Model : Random Forest model (RF) in training and validation 
All data can be accessed in the folder "data_R". Some large files are available here https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PapRwJpQDnngSl2IoGPZi7dOGpz_DzPL?usp=sharing , where you can use preloaded data.Rdata files : Data_before_integration.Rdata is used for section 1-3 and Data_after_integration.Rdata is used for section 4-5.
A custom function for all sections is "custom_functions.r"
## Code Explanation
Please find a detailed explanation in the “Tutorials” folder.

## Data sources and processing

## Overview of the workflow

## Output
You can find the output from codes in folder “Outputs” including variable selection results and RF model performance.
